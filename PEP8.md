# PEP 8 Standards Summary

## Introduction

PEP 8 is the official style guide for writing Python code.  
It provides guidelines and best practices to improve code readability and maintain consistency across Python projects.

PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.

## Why PEP 8 is Important

Following PEP 8 helps in:

- Writing clean and readable code
- Maintaining consistency in projects
- Improving collaboration between developers
- Making code easier to debug and maintain

Readable code is considered more important than complex code.

---

## Naming Conventions

### Variables and Functions

- Use lowercase letters
- Separate words with underscores
- Example format: `my_variable`, `calculate_sum`

### Classes

- Use CapitalizedWords (PascalCase)
- Example format: `MyClass`, `StudentDetails`

### Constants

- Use uppercase letters
- Separate words with underscores
- Example format: `MAX_SIZE`, `TOTAL_COUNT`

---

## Indentation

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level
- Do not use tabs
- Keep indentation consistent throughout the file

---

## Line Length

- Limit lines to 79 characters
- For comments and docstrings, limit to 72 characters
- Break long lines properly for readability

---

## Blank Lines

- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes
- Use blank lines to improve code readability
- Avoid excessive blank lines

---

## Imports

- Imports should be at the top of the file
- Each import should be on a separate line
- Follow this order:
  - Standard library imports
  - Related third-party imports
  - Local application imports

---

## Whitespace Usage

- Avoid extra spaces inside brackets
- Use single space around operators
- Avoid unnecessary trailing spaces

---

## Comments and Docstrings

- Write clear and meaningful comments
- Use complete sentences
- Use docstrings for functions, classes, and modules
- Keep comments updated with code changes

---

## General Recommendations

- Keep code simple and readable
- Avoid overly complex logic
- Follow consistency throughout the project
- Readability counts

---

## Conclusion

PEP 8 is an essential guideline for writing clean and professional Python code.  
By following PEP 8 standards, developers create code that is easier to read, maintain, and collaborate on. Consistent styling improves overall software quality and long-term project sustainability.
